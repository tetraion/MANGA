# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a manga-related project that is currently in its initial setup phase. The repository contains only an empty `.env` file at this time.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the development commands and architecture will need to be established as the project grows. When setting up the project, consider adding:

- Package management configuration (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
- Build and development scripts
- Testing framework setup
- Linting and formatting tools

## Architecture

The project architecture is yet to be defined. As development progresses, this section should be updated with:

- Main application structure
- Key directories and their purposes
- Data flow and component relationships
- External dependencies and integrations

## Environment Configuration

The project includes a `.env` file for environment variables. Ensure sensitive information like API keys are never committed to the repository.
